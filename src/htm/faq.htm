		<a href="#how-old-can-i-be" class="faq__question text3 Mt(0)" id="how-old-can-i-be">
			How old can I be to join AEGEE-London?
		</a>
		<p>
			You need to be 18-35 years old to join us and have the right to apply for European events. However if you’re 17-40 you can also join us and attend local events we organise in London. If you’re 17 years old and you want to apply to a Summer University, you can join us and attend the SU as long as you’re 18 when the SU is happening. Allowed local age ranges vary between antennae. For AEGEE-London is 17-40 but it could be different for other antennae.

		<a href="#do-i-need-to-be-university-student" class="faq__question text3" id="do-i-need-to-be-university-student">
			Do I need to be university student to join AEGEE-London?
		</a>
		<p>
			No, you don’t need to be current or former university student to join us. AEGEE-London has no qualification requirements. Nevertheless, for your information we tell you that at AEGEE-London most of us are former university students and current workers. On other antennae around Europe the most common type of member is university student.

		<a href="#can-i-join-aegee-london-even-if-i-dont-live-in-london" class="faq__question text3" id="can-i-join-aegee-london-even-if-i-dont-live-in-london">
			Can I join AEGEE-London even if I don't live in London or I cannot attend any event?
		</a>
		<p>
			Yes, you can. It doesn't matter where you live or whether you join us just for the European events. You're more than welcome!
		</p>
		<a href="#what-have-to-do-summer-universities-with-real-universities" class="faq__question text3" id="what-have-to-do-summer-universities-with-real-universities">
			What have to do Summer Universities with real universities?
		</a>
		<p>
			Nothing. It's just a somewhat misleading name for a two-week summer camp for adults full of cultural activities like travelling, languages, workshops, cooking and, of course, party. You don't need to be university student to attend a Summer University.
		</p>
		<a href="#when-do-you-organise-the-next-event" class="faq__question text3" id="when-do-you-organise-the-next-event">
			When do you organise the next event or gather together?
		</a>
		<p>
			All the activities we do, whether they are social drinks, day trips or exchanges are published on our Facebook page as an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aegeelondon/events" target="_blank">event</a>. We also share the event on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aegeelondon" target="_blank">AEGEE-London Activities Facebook group</a>. So the best thing you can do to not miss any event is to join that group. You’ll receive a notification every time we create a new event.

		<a href="#could-you-arrange-any-lodging-for-me" class="faq__question text3" id="could-you-arrange-any-lodging-for-me">
			I’m from another antenna and I’m coming to London soon. Could you arrange any lodging for me?
		</a>
		<p>
			AEGEE-London is a small antenna. Unlike other antennae around Europe which may offer some help for visiting aegeeans we don’t have deals or aggreaments with hostels or university dormitories. Instead send us a <a href="#contact">message</a> to ask whether we could host you.
		</p>
		<a href="#would-you-like-to-meet" class="faq__question text3" id="would-you-like-to-meet">
			I’m from another antenna and I’m coming to London soon. Would you like to meet and have some drinks with me?
		</a>
		<p>
			Of course! Publish a post on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aegeelondon" target="_blank">AEGEE-London Activities group</a> so that everyone knows you’re coming. If you don't want to make your visit so public you can drop us a private <a href="#contact">message</a>.

			Which social networks do you use?
		</a>
		<p>
			Previously we used Twitter, Google+ and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/124330421@N07" target="_blank">Flickr</a> but these all accounts are now closed or outdated. At the moment we only use <a href="http://facebook.com/aegeelondon" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
		</p>
		<a href="#is-aegee-london-an-ngo" class="faq__question text3" id="is-aegee-london-an-ngo">
			Is AEGEE-London an NGO?
		</a>
		<p>
			Yes, AEGEE-London and all AEGEE antennae around Europe are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization" target="_blank">non-profit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization" target="_blank">non-governmental</a> organizations. Specifically, under English law we're constituted as an <a href=" https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/unincorporated-association" target="_blank">unincorporated association</a> (more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unincorporated_associations_in_English_law" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>). More simply, we're a <span class="b">student organisation</span> (most of us are or have been students). However you don't need to be student to join us.

		<a href="#do-you-have-physical-offices" class="faq__question text3" id="do-you-have-physical-offices">
			Do you have physical offices?
		</a>
		<p>
			No, we haven’t got any space to be our headquarters. Every time the board meets we do it online or in a pub, as good British habits dictate. What a better way to hold sessions and take tough decisions than by drinking a pint of beer.
		</p>
		<a href="#are-you-present-at-some-london-university" class="faq__question text3" id="are-you-present-at-some-london-university">
			Are you present at some London university?
		</a>
		<p>
			When we were funded in early 2013 we had some board members studying at University of Hull and LSE, and we got support from some of their teachers [<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B16wwN1jG4T2UV9NZ2dpU0c5QWM" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B16wwN1jG4T2MW1xRVJxUkdCc2c" target="_blank">2</a>]. But at the moment -2017- we are NOT present at any London university.
			<br/><br/>
			How is possible that a student organisation has no presence on its main environment? Firtsly because we've always strugled to settle at British universities. But secondly because AEGEE isn’t exclusively a student organisation. It also accepts students that have finished studies and have become workers (it even accepts members with no university education at all).
			<br/><br/>
			At AEGEE-London we're mostly university students that have become workers, though it would be nice if we'd have more students like you among our members. You won’t find any AEGEE leaflet or poster at your faculty but you and your friends are very welcome to <a href="#join-us" target="_blank">join us</a>! You’ll enjoy our <a href="#join-us" target="_blank">activities</a> with people from all around Europe.

		<a href="#where-does-the-antenna-get-funds-from" class="faq__question text3" id="where-does-the-antenna-get-funds-from">
			Where does the antenna get funds from?
		</a>
		<p>
			At the moment our only source of income are members' fees. So far we haven't organised any fundraising events like parties or trips. We don’t have either sponsorship agreements with companies or universities. The activities we organise require the member to pay his/her own expenses (mainly train and club tickets, and food and drinks). We hope that in the future this will change and we will be able to organise fundraising events.
