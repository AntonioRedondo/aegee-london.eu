		<p>
			You need to be 18-35 years old to join us and have the right to apply for European events. However if you’re 17-40 you can also join us and attend local events we organise in London. If you’re 17 years old and you want to apply to a Summer University you can join us and attend the SU as long as you’re 18 when the SU is happening. Allowed local age ranges vary between antennas. For AEGEE-London is 17-40 but it could be different for other antennas.

		<p>
			No, you don’t need to be current or former university student to join us. AEGEE-London has no qualification requirements. Nevertheless, for your information we tell you that at AEGEE-London most of us are former university students and current workers. On other antennas around Europe the most common type of member is university student.

		<p>
			Yes, you can. It doesn't matter where you live or whether you join us just for the European events like Summer Universities. Just <a href="#join-us">click here</a> to join us. You're more than welcome!

		<p>
			Nothing. It's just a somewhat misleading name for a two-week summer camp for adults full of cultural activities. The kind of activities you'll enjoy during a <a href="http://www.projects.aegee.org/suct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer University</a> (abbreviated as SU) is travelling, languages, workshops, cooking and, of course, party. You don't need to be university student to attend a SU. The reason for these events being called in this way is that thanks to the SU cultural program you will learn many things (like at university) during summer time.

			All the activities we do, whether they are social drinks, day trips or exchanges are published on our Facebook page as an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aegeelondon/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">event</a>. We also share the event on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aegeelondon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AEGEE-London Activities Facebook group</a>. So the best thing you can do to not miss any event is to join that group. You’ll receive a notification every time we create a new event.

			AEGEE-London is a small antenna. Unlike other antennas around Europe which may offer some help for visiting aegeeans we don’t have deals or agreements with hostels or university dormitories. Instead send us a <a href="#contact">message</a> to ask whether we could host you.

			Of course! Publish a post on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/aegeelondon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AEGEE-London Activities group</a> so that everyone knows you’re coming. If you don't want to make your visit so public you can drop us a private <a href="#contact">message</a>.

			Yes, AEGEE-London and all AEGEE antennas around Europe are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-profit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-governmental</a> organizations. Specifically, under English law we're constituted as an <a href=" https://www.gov.uk/business-legal-structures/unincorporated-association" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unincorporated association</a> (more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unincorporated_associations_in_English_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>). More simply, we're a <span class="b">student organisation</span> (most of us are or have been students). However you don't need to be student to join us.

		<p>
			No, we haven’t got any space to be our headquarters. Every time the board meets we do it online, or in some board member's house, or even better, in a pub, as good British habits dictate. What a better way to hold sessions and take tough decisions than by drinking a pint of beer!

			When we were funded in early 2013 we had board members studying at University of Hull and LSE, and we got support from some of their teachers [<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B16wwN1jG4T2UV9NZ2dpU0c5QWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B16wwN1jG4T2MW1xRVJxUkdCc2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>]. Since then we haven't been present at any London university.
			<br/><br/>
			But how is it possible that a student organisation has no presence on its natural environment? We've always struggled to settle in British universities. Also AEGEE isn’t exclusively a student organisation. We accept anyone who has already finished studies and has become worker. We also accept members with no university education at all.
			<br/><br/>
			At AEGEE-London we're mostly former university students who have become workers. It would be nice to have more students among our members though. You won’t find any AEGEE leaflet or poster at a London faculty but if you're a student you and your friends are very welcome to <a href="#join-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join us</a>! You’ll enjoy our <a href="#activities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activities</a> with people from all around Europe.

		<p>
			At the moment our only source of income are members' fees. So far we haven't organised any fundraising events like parties or trips. We don’t have either sponsorship agreements with companies or universities. The activities we organise require the member to pay their own expenses (mainly train and club tickets, and food and drinks). We hope that in the future this will change and we'll be able to organise fundraising events.

		</h2>
		<p>
			We don't have many funds, but we don't have many expenses either. The main expense we have is the payment we have to do twice a year before each Agora to AEGEE-Europe. This payment is proportional to the number of members we have, to our members' fee and to the number of people who applied to Summer Universities from our antenna.
			<br/><br/>
			All our finances are audited by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/auditcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audit Commission of AEGEE-Europe</a> through a yearly financial report that needs to be approved by this commission in order to us continuing being an antenna within the AEGEE network. We have a bank account with Barclays and an account on PayPal.
