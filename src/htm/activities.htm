			Activities in London
		</h2>
		<p class="dropcap">
			AEGEE-London is the perfect place if what you want is to know students and young workers who enjoy the incredible city of London and share the common belief of a united and open Europe. Our main activities are social drinks, day trips to places around London and exchanges with other antennae. This city has a high density of classy and old English pubs where a pint of beer or cider can be afforded even by the most tight millennial budgets.
		</p>
		<p class="dropcap Pt(3%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
			Our social drinks include pub crawls, gathering for the Eurovision Song Contest or informative drinks to explain what are Summer Universities. On our day trips we have been to Kew Gardens, Epping Forest, Brighton, Canterbury, Birmingham and many other places.

			Activities around Europe
		</h2>
		<p class="dropcap">
			International events are at the heart of AEGEE. Our Identity reflects five different means: Intercultural exchange, personal development and non-formal education, thematic projects, policy and advocacy and forum for discussion. During conferences, exchanges, trainings and many other events, students have the opportunity to meet and to exchange their opinions, ideas, and impressions on various topics. These events are organised by AEGEE locals, Working Groups, or projects, often based on a cooperation among these bodies.

				Summer Universities
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Summer University is an event that takes place during summer between one and two weeks in most of the cities that AEGEE is present. Understanding and exploring the multicultural dimension of the European continent, removing national borders, fighting for tolerance and creating open-minded citizens are some of the reasons why 20 to 50 young Europeans from all over Europe come together in each Summer University to taste the diversity of multiculturalism.
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				In a Summer University you will be given the chance to taste different food, to listen to different music, to dance with that music and at the end love it, to be good friends with people from different countries and then arranging trips together, you will learn to say "hi" in another 20 languages, you will feel free, you will love, you will experience, you will learn new things, you will do things you hadn't imagined… You will feel the AEGEE spirit, you will feel what is a SU!

				Agoras
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Agora is the General Assembly of the association, held twice a year, in spring and in autumn, gathering 600-1000 students for four days. It is one of the most important events in AEGEE. Apart from being the venue where the board of directors of the organisation, the Comité Directeur (CD) are elected every spring, it is also a life-changing experience for the participants, the young Europeans who are gathering in one place to build the future of the organisation and together.
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				The main discussions and decisions take place during the plenary meetings. The participants of the Agora also join workshops, prytania (to discuss changes to the statutes of the organisation), progress meetings about ongoing projects, and other programmes.

				Network Meetings
			</h2>
			<p>
				A Network Meeting (abbreviated as <span class="b">NWM</span>, Network Winter Meeting) helps to create contacts and start cooperation between <span class="b">AEGEE locals situated nearby each other</span>. They're organised by a member of the Network Commission in co-operation with an AEGEE local.
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				They are the <span class="b">opportunity to discuss common activities and share experiences</span>, but also learn more about European projects and discuss general AEGEE matters. New AEGEE members can learn about youth work from experienced AEGEE members. It's also an ideal possibility for AEGEE members to discuss common problems and develop a cooperation for organising future events.
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				During a NWM several types of activities are conducted: workshops on project management, public relations, fund raising, presentation skills, NGOs, the European level of AEGEE, making movies, presentations of past and upcoming projects in the Network, discussions concerning current youth issues, youth unemployment, students’ mobility, etc.

				Training Courses

			<p>
				<span class="b">Non-formal education is an integral part of AEGEE</span>. Many AEGEE’s training events are organised by the <a href="http://www.aegee-academy.org/" target="_blank">Academy</a> often in cooperation with other AEGEE bodies who are experts in certain fields such as committees of project teams. These training events are called European Schools. The events focus on a certain theme or topic, for example including Project Management, Public Relations, Fund Raising, and others.
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Antennae can also organise training events</span>. They are called <span class="b">LTCs</span> (Local Training Courses) and <span class="b">RTCs</span> (Regional Training Courses).
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				During these events, participants get a chance to understand the workings of NGOs operate, at the same time developing their skills. Diverse training methods, which include lectures, workshops and case work, create the perfect environment for fast knowledge absorption among the trainees.

			<p>
				Aegeeans love to gather toguether just for the sake of fun and friendship! Any excuse is good for party and for that many events all around Europe are organised just to spend time in good company.
			</p>
			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">Anniversaries</span> of the organisation or antennae are a common reason to plan an European event. It's always a source of joy and celebration to remember the origins of AEGEE, to not forget our values and to make possible to celebrate more anniversaries in the future. Some recent anniversaries were the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1554591054824066" target="_blank">30th Anniversary of AEGEE</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1056092457807140" target="_blank">29th Anniversary of AEGEE-Berlin</a> or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/734455533358756" target="_blank">25th Anniversary of AEGEE-Praha</a>.

			<p class="Pt(4%) Pt(6vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">New Year's Eves</span> are also great events organised all around Europe by many antennae. Have crazy party with champagne and mulled wine at the same time you visit European cities -often covered in snow- with beautiful Christmas markets and delicious winter foods.
