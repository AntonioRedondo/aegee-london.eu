				Being member of the board means to devote a bit of your free time to help to run our lovely antenna. We know that you're bussy studing or working full-time. We'll provide you with information and help in your role at the board. Knowledge transfer is a very important step for the right working of the antenna.

				In order to become member of the board:

			<ul class="Mt(0.5vw)">
				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					You need to know what is AEGEE. You need to have been member of some AEGEE antenna previously for at least 6 months.

				<li class="Pt(2vw)--mo">
					You want and have the time to be commited to AEGEE-London and make sure you carry out the tasks assigned to your board position.

			<p class="Mt(1vw) Pt(2vw)--mo">
				<span class="b">You don't need to be member of the board to put your two cents</span>. If you don't want to be so committed yet want to help, by just having friends or contacts that were happy to become member of AEGEE-London and you let them know about our local events, that would be a very good way to contribute.

				The Convention d’Adhésion establishes the official birth of our antenna and contains ten articles that must be followed by both AEGEE-London and AEGEE-Europe. Eszter Bangó (first antenna's president, the blond girl behind the lectern on the above picture) and Maarten Veldmans (one of the founders, on the pic holding the microphone) attended the Agora in Mannheim, to sign the Convention.

				2013 wasn't the first time AEGEE-London was <a href="http://www.zeus.aegee.org/magazine/2013/02/26/new-contact-in-london-promoting-multiculturalism-in-britain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a>. The first time that AEGEE-London was really born was in 1985/1986. The current board doesn't have any record of the exact date. It existed until at least 1995 (we have a t-shirt of AEGEE-London of that year). However, afterwards, it died. Just until 2013 when it reborn to become again a wonderful antenna.
